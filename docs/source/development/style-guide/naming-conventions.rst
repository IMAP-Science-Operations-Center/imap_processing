Naming Conventions
------------------

The repository shall adhere to specific naming conventions to allow for more consistency:

* Repositories shall have branches named ``main`` and ``dev``, instead of ``master`` and ``development``
* Repositories shall be named with underscores instead of hyphens (e.g. ``imap_processing`` instead of
  ``imap-processing``)
