Checklist for Contributors and Reviewers of Pull Requests
---------------------------------------------------------

The following is a guide to be used for contributors and reviewers of ``imap_processing`` pull requests. Note that this
is only a guide; it should not be treated as a fully comprehensive, foolproof list that must be used in all situations,
and parts of it are subjective.

If the contributor/reviewer can answer "yes" to all the following questions, then conceivably the proposed changes are
acceptable and the PR can be reviewed.

Before merging, make sure you have addressed all the comments in the review per our :ref:`PR standards <pull-request-review-standards>`.
