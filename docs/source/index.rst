IMAP Processing Documentation
=============================

The Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) is an exciting project
aimed at studying the interstellar medium and investigating the acceleration
mechanisms of particles within our galaxy. IMAP utilizes cutting-edge
technology and advanced instrumentation to gather valuable data and expand
our understanding of space.

The IMAP project's Git repository serves as a centralized hub for collaboration
among researchers, scientists, and developers involved in the project.
It provides a platform for version control, code sharing, issue tracking,
and documentation, fostering a collaborative environment for advancing
the goals of the IMAP mission.

Through the Git repository, contributors can access project resources,
explore the codebase, propose enhancements or bug fixes, and participate
in discussions with other team members. This collaborative approach promotes
efficient development and fosters innovation in the pursuit of interstellar
mapping and particle acceleration research.

Join the IMAP Git repository to be part of an exciting scientific endeavor,
contribute your expertise, and help unlock the mysteries of the interstellar
medium and particle acceleration in our galaxy. Together, we can advance our
knowledge of the cosmos and pave the way for future discoveries in space
exploration.

The [IMAP Website](https://imap.princeton.edu/) contains information about the
entire mission, including the science goals, the spacecraft, and the instruments.
The Science Operations Center (SOC) is responsible for the data processing on the
IMAP mission and being developed at
[LASP (Laboratory of Atmospheric and Space Physics)](https://lasp.colorado.edu/).

The explicit code interfaces and structure are described in the :ref:`api`.
