####################

The Python library `cdflib <https://github.com/MAVENSDC/cdflib>`_ is a pure-python implementation of the CDF specification.  Of particular note is the function `xarray_to_cdf <https://cdflib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cdflib.xarray.xarray_to_cdf.html#cdflib.xarray.xarray_to_cdf>`_.
Because IMAP L0->L2 processing is using xarray for internal data representation, **IMAP L0->L2 processing will be using this function to generate all CDF files**.

This function takes an `xarray.Dataset <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html>`_ object as input, and will output a CDF file.  Further details about how it works are below.

Xarray Introduction
===================

Xarray is a powerful python library for handling multi-dimensional data.  It has a strong connection with the netCDF file format.  The developers intended xaray to be an "in-memory" representation of a netCDF file.

Perhaps the largest difference between netCDF and CDF is that netCDF has built-in methods to attach *dimensions* and *coordinates* to data.  Similarly, xarray Datasets have this capability as well.
Full documentation about xarray Dataset objects are located here `https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html>`_

Within a CDF file, there is no inherent way to attach coordinates to a variable.  CDF is a simpler format, and only has the concept of Attributes and Variables.  The "CDF-native" way of specifying dimensions to a variable is to use "DEPEND" attributes (see sections :ref:`ISTP Compliance` and :ref:```DEPEND_i```).

.. note:: the netCDF file format was created by NOAA a few years after the CDF file format to plug in some of the shortfallings of the CDF file format.  These days, the orginal reasons for the split between the two formats have largely disappeared.

xarray_to_cdf
=============

The following is a minimal example of working with xarray_to_cdf -

.. code-block:: python

   from cdflib.xarray import xarray_to_cdf
   import xarray as xaray
   var_data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 2, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
   var_dim = ['epoch', 'energy']
   epoch_data = [1, 2, 3]
   epoch = xr.Variable(epoch_dims, epoch_data)
   ds = xr.Dataset(data_vars={'data': data, 'epoch': epoch})
   xarray_to_cdf(ds, 'hello.cdf')

The xarray_to_cdf function converts an xarray.Dataset object into a CDF file.

For IMAP, we will be using the following flags on xarray_to_cdf

* datetime64_to_cdftt2000
   * Working with numpy datetime64 objects for time is recommended because of the precision afforded, as well as the speed of calculations
* istp
   * Enabled by default.  This flag will perform some checks to verify that the function is able to make ISTP compliant CDF files from the Dataset object.
* terminate_on_warning
   * This flag ensures that the function terminates if there are any issues found, so we can avoid creating incomplete or non-compliant files.

xarray_to_cdf with the above flags will perform the following steps -

Verification
------------

#. Verifies that required global attributes are present to meet ISTP compliance
#. Verifies that variables have a VAR_TYPE attribute of either "data", "support_data", or "metadata"
#. Verifies that all variables have the appropriate number of DEPEND_{i} attributes, based on the number of dimensions of the variable
#. Verfies that the DEPEND_{i} attributes point to variables that are the size and shape expected to act as coordinates
#. Verifies that each variable has the expected variable attributes to be ISTP compliant

Conversion
----------

#. Converts all variables with the word "epoch" in their name from datetime64 objects into the CDF native time format of CDF_TT2000 (nanoseconds since the year 2000)
#. Converts all other data into one of the following CDF native formats - CDF_INT8, CDF_DOUBLE, CDF_UINT4, or CDF_CHAR
#. Converts the attributes VALIDMIN, VALIDMAX, and FILLVAL to have the same data type as the data they are attached to
   * For example, if you specify the attribute VALIDMIN=5 for a variable named epoch, it will be converted to a CDF_TT2000 data type when written to the file
#. Writes the Dataset attributes to the CDF file as the CDF's Global Attributes
#. Writes the Dataset's variables to the CDF file
   * Any variable with DEPEND_0 = epoch as an attribute will be set to vary across records in the CDF file.  Otherwise, the data will be contained within a single record.
#. Writes the attributes attached to the Dataset Variables to the file


Shortcomings
-------------
While the above steps get a CDF file a large way towards ISTP compliance, there are several important caveats to take note of -

* This code does not check the values *within* the attributes (except VAR_TYPE and DEPEND_{i}), only that the attributes exist!
* This function does not put the "epoch" variable as the first thing in the file, which was recommended (but not required) by the SPDF
* This code creates variables in a row-major format.  Column-major is recommended (but not required) by the SPDF.

IMAP xarray_to_cdf Example
**************************

Suppose there is an instrument on IMAP named JIM that took 3 samples of ions at 3 different energies, such that the data looks like the following -

+------------------------+------------+------------+------------+
| Time \                 | 0.5-1.5 eV | 1.5-2.5 eV | 2.5-3.5 eV |
| Energy Bins            |            |            |            |
+========================+============+============+============+
| 2025-01-01T00:00:01    | 1          | 2          | 3          |
+------------------------+------------+------------+------------+
| 2025-01-01T00:00:02    | 4          | 5          | 6          |
+------------------------+------------+------------+------------+
| 2025-01-01T00:00:03    | 7          | 8          | 9          |
+------------------------+------------+------------+------------+
