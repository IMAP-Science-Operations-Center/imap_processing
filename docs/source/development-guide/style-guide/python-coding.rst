Python Coding
-------------

Code shall adhere to the `PEP8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_ conventions save for the following exceptions:

* Lines of code need to be restricted to 88 characters to adhere to the ``ruff`` code formatter.
* Avoid one-letter or unnecessarily-abbreviated variable names (e.g. use ``temperature`` instead of ``temp``,
  ``filename`` instead of ``fn``).
* Function and class definitions should be placed in alphabetical order in the module.
* It is encouraged to annotate variables and functions using the `typing
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_ library.
