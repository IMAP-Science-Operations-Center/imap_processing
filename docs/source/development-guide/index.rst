:ref:`getting-started`

To contribute to imap_processing, you can fork the GitHub repository,
add your code, and make a pull request. If you are adding additional functionality,
you should also include a test with your enhancement.

imap_processing is designed to be run in a containerized environment, so
the dependencies will be locked in after a release and the data products will
be versioned appropriately to correspond with the code that produced them.
