Poetry
======

We are using `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_ for the dependency management in both ``sds-data-manager`` and ``imap_processing``. All dependency management should go through Poetry, following our standard :ref:`poetry-environment`.

.. _poetry-overview-link:

Poetry overview
---------------

Poetry is a tool which provides the ability to manage :ref:`dependencies <poetry-dependency-link>` in Python. Although there are lots of tools which do this, including the built-in pip, Poetry has several specific advantages:

#. Poetry allows you to "lock" dependency versions in place.
#. Poetry will automatically determine if dependencies are compatible.
#. Poetry can provide dependency groups, which allow you to specify which subset of dependencies you would like to install.

These advantages ensure that we can all install the same versions of tools, that these versions are compatible with each other, and that we can manage dependencies in a fine tuned way. When you run ``poetry install`` to install your dependencies, you can be confident that they are the dependency versions that other people have been testing with.

Poetry also provides tools for automatically bumping dependency versions only where it makes sense. You can specify when a dependency should get a version change using Poetry's extensive `dependency specification <https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/>`_ formatting.

Finally, Poetry provides a :ref:`shell <poetry-shell-link>`, which you can use as a virtual environment. This shell is automatically tied to the project directory, and allows developers to install dependency versions in an isolated environment. This means that, for example, if you have a different project using the same package with a different version, you can have each project with it's own version kept separate from conflicts.

We have a :ref:`Poetry style guide<poetry-environment>` for specific recommendations about using Poetry in these projects.

Using Poetry
------------

Poetry can be installed with the `official instructions <https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/>`_.

The dependencies for the project are all specified in the ``pyproject.toml`` file in the base level of the repository.

The Poetry project has a great `basic usage guide <https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/basic-usage/>`_ which introduces the basic capabilities. This covers the basic commands which are used in installing and managing Poetry.

You can use Poetry in addition to other Python tools. Unlike with Conda, installing Poetry should not interfere with other projects which may use other tools. You can also use different methods for virtual environments if you prefer, which is covered under the :ref:`Poetry shell section <poetry-shell-link>`. Poetry uses pip to install under the hood.

.. _poetry-dependency-link:

Adding Dependencies
-------------------

Poetry has a command to `add a new dependency <https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/cli/#add>`_, with an optional version specification:

::

    # Add a new dependency
    poetry add pendulum@^2.0.5

    # Add a new dependency with default latest version
    poetry add pendulum

These dependencies are then added automatically to the ``pyproject.toml`` file. The overall project dependencies go under ``[tool.poetry.dependencies]``. The main project dependencies are always installed.

You can also update the ``pyproject.toml`` file directly, using the existing formatting or the `Poetry documentation on it <https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/>`_ as a guide.

After you update any dependencies, you will need to update the lock file::
    poetry lock

This will create a new version of the ``poetry.lock`` file, which should be committed to the repository. Our pre-commit tools also do this step automatically if needed.

.. _poetry-dependency-groups-link:

Dependency groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Poetry also provides dependency groups for separating dependencies into logical separations. If you are installing the project as an end user, you do not need the development tools. The testing environment does not need the documentation generation dependencies. In our case, the AWS Lambda environment does not need the same dependencies as the CDK deployment. Before you add a dependency to the main group, ask yourself if it would make more sense in one of the other existing dependency groups.

To add a dependency to an existing group, you can use the ``--group`` flag::

    poetry add mkdocs --group docs

These groups can be made optional as well, meaning they will not be installed by default when the user runs ``poetry install``. You can specify what groups to install using the ``--with`` or ``--without`` flags.

Pip also provides a standard for optional dependencies. These can be installed when using ``pip`` instead of Poetry to install the dependencies. This goes under the ``[tool.poetry.extras]`` section in ``pyproject.toml``. These are separate, but similar to the optional dependencies. They can only be all installed or all not installed, with no splitting out into specific groups like the dependency groups.

.. _poetry-shell-link:

Installing and the Poetry Shell
--------------------------------

To install the Poetry project, you can use the `install <https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#install>`_ command::

    # We use dynamic versioning, which requires a plugin to be installed first
    poetry self add "poetry-dynamic-versioning[plugin]"

    # Install main dependencies and any dependency groups which are installed by default
    poetry install

    # install without specific dependency groups
    poetry install --without test,docs

    # Install with optional dependency groups
    poetry install --with lambda_dev

By default, this command will install dependencies out of the ``poetry.lock`` file. This will also install into your Poetry shell for the project.

The Poetry shell is a virtual environment tool provided by Poetry. To start the Poetry shell, with your dependencies installed, you can use the poetry `shell <https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#shell>`_ command::

    poetry shell

    # To exit the shell
    exit

However, you are not required to use the Poetry shell as your virtual environment manager if you have another tool you prefer.

Poetry will, by default, not create a new virtual environment if it detects that it is running in a virtual environment already. So, for example, you can use a `Conda environment <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ by activating the environment first, and then running `poetry install`.

There are also `settings <https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvscreate>`_ surrounding the virtual environment that you can change to suit your workflow.
