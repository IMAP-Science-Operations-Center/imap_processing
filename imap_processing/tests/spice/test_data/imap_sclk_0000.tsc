IMAP Spacecraft Clock Kernel (SCLK)
===========================================================================

     This file is a SPICE spacecraft clock (SCLK) kernel containing
     information required for time conversions involving the on-board
     IMAP spacecraft clock.

Version
--------------------------------------------------------

     IMAP SCLK Kernel Version:

     IMAP version 0.3 - April 22, 2022 -- Mike Ruffolo
        Updated to use NAIF SC ID 43

     IMAP Version 0.2 - June 2, 2021 -- Caroline Cocca
         Updated to use temporary spacecraft id of 225

     IMAP Version 0.1 - March 6, 2015 -- Eric Melin
         Updated text to replace references to RBSP with SPP

     IMAP Version 0.0 - August 7, 2014 -- Eric Melin
        The initial SPP spice kernel.
        This file was created by using RBSPA initial kernel and
        modifying the spacecraft ID.


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------

     This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that
     make use of this SCLK kernel must 'load' the kernel, normally
     during program initialization.  Loading the kernel associates
     the data items with their names in a data structure called the
     'kernel pool'.  The SPICELIB routine FURNSH loads text kernel
     files, such as this one, into the pool as shown below:

        FORTRAN:

                  CALL FURNSH ( SCLK_kernel_name )

        C:

                  furnsh_c ( SCLK_kernel_name );

     Once loaded, the SCLK time conversion routines will be able to
     access the necessary data located in this kernel for their
     designed purposes.

Kernel Data
--------------------------------------------------------

     The first block of keyword equals value assignments define the
     type, parallel time system, and format of the spacecraft clock.
     These fields are invariant from SCLK kernel update to SCLK
     kernel update.

     The IMAP spacecraft clock is represented by the SPICE
     type 1 SCLK kernel.  It uses TDT, Terrestrial Dynamical Time,
     as its parallel time system.

\begindata

SCLK_KERNEL_ID             = ( @2009-07-09T12:20:32 )
SCLK_DATA_TYPE_43          = (        1 )
SCLK01_TIME_SYSTEM_43      = (        2 )


\begintext

     In a particular partition of the IMAP spacecraft clock,
     the clock read-out consists of two separate stages:

                           1/18424652:24251

     The first stage, a 32 bit field, represents the spacecraft
     clock seconds count.  The second, a 16 bit field, represents
     counts of 20 microsecond increments of the spacecraft clock.

     The following keywords and their values establish this structure:

\begindata

SCLK01_N_FIELDS_43         = (            2 )
SCLK01_MODULI_43           = (   4294967296       50000 )
SCLK01_OFFSETS_43          = (            0           0 )
SCLK01_OUTPUT_DELIM_43     = (            2 )


\begintext

     This concludes the invariant portion of the SCLK kernel data.  The
     remaining sections of the kernel may require updates as the clock
     correlation coefficients evolve in time.  The first section below
     establishes the clock partitions.  The data in this section consists
     of two parallel arrays, which denote the start and end values in
     ticks of each partition of the spacecraft clock.

     SPICE utilizes these two arrays to map from spacecraft clock ticks,
     determined with the usual modulo arithmetic, to encoded SCLK--the
     internal, monotonically increasing sequence used to tag various
     data sources with spacecraft clock.

\begindata

SCLK_PARTITION_START_43    = ( 0.00000000000000e+00 )

SCLK_PARTITION_END_43      = ( 2.14748364799999e+14 )

\begintext

     The remaining section of the SCLK kernel defines the clock correlation
     coefficients.  Each line contains a 'coefficient triple':

         Encoded SCLK at which Rate is introduced.
         Corresponding TDT Epoch at which Rate is introduced.
         Rate in TDT (seconds) / most significant clock count (~seconds).

     SPICE uses linear extrapolation to convert between the parallel time
     system and encoded SCLK.  The triples are stored in the array defined
     below.

     The first time triplet below was entered manually and represents the
     approximate time (in TDT) at which SCLK = zero.  The current plan for
     IMAP is that the given epoch will be used for both Observatory I&T
     and launch.  Note that the conversion from UTC to TDT used 34 leap
     seconds.

\begindata

SCLK01_COEFFICIENTS_43     = (

                   0     @01-JAN-2010-00:01:06.184000     1.00000000000
