  Descriptor: SWAPI>The Solar Wind and Pickup Ion
  TEXT: >
    The Solar Wind and Pickup Ion (SWAPI) instrument measures several different
    elements of the solar wind, including hydrogen (H) and helium (He) ions,
    and, on occasion, heavy ions produced by large events from the Sun. See
    https://imap.princeton.edu/instruments/swapi for more details. SWAPI level-1
    data contains primary, secondary, coincidence counts per ESA voltage step and
    time. Level-2 data contains the same data as level-1 but counts are converted
    to rates by dividing counts by time.
  Instrument_type: Particles (space)
