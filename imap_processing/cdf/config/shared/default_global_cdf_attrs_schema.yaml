    DOI is a persistent Unique Digital Identifier with the form
    https://doi.org/<PREFIX>/<SUFFIX> with the <PREFIX> identifying the DOI
    registration authority and the <SUFFIX> identifying the dataset. The DOI should point to
    a landing page for additional information about the dataset. DOIs are typically created by

MODS:
  description: >
    This attribute is an SPDF standard global attribute, which is used to denote the history of
    modifications made to the CDF data set. The MODS attribute should contain a
    description of all significant changes to the data set, essentially capturing a log of high-
    level release notes. This attribute can have as many entries as necessary and should be
    updated if the Interface Number ("X") of the version number changes.

TEXT:
  description: >
    This attribute is an SPDF standard global attribute, which is a text description of the
    experiment whose data is included in the CDF. A reference to a journal article(s) or to a
    World Wide Web page describing the experiment is essential and constitutes the
    minimum requirement. A written description of the data set is also desirable. This
    attribute can have as many entries as necessary to contain the desired information.
    Typically, this attribute is about a paragraph in length and is not shown on CDAWeb.
    CDAWeb is the web portal for access to SPDF data, available at https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov.
