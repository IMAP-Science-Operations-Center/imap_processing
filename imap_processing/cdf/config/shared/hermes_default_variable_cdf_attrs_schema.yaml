      Reference_Position is optional metadata to account for time variance with position in 
      the gravity wells and with relative velocity. While we could use a combined 
      TimeSystem attribute that defines mission-specific time scales where needed, such as 
      UTC-at-STEREO-B, it's cleaner to keep them separate as Time_Scale=UTC and 
      Reference_Position=STEREO-B.

      second in ISO8601 relative time (+/- time, most commonly: "+1s") [default: standard 
      list of leap seconds up to time of data]. Leap_Seconds_Included is needed to account 
      for time scales that don't have all 34 (in 2009) leap seconds and for the clocks in 
      various countries that started using leap seconds at different times. The full list is 
      required to handle the equally or more common case where a time scale starts at a 
      pecific UTC but continues on without leap seconds in TAI mode; this is basically what 
      missions that don't add leap seconds are doing.

      dimensions of the original variable. The value of LABL_PTR_1 is a variable which will

      unitless, and thus lack a conversion factor, this data attribute will be " > " where ' ' is
