  Descriptor: GLOWS>GLObal Solar Wind Structure
  TEXT: >
    The GLObal Solar Wind Structure (GLOWS) is a non-imaging single-pixel Lyman-alpha
    photometer that will be used to observe the sky distribution of the helioglow to
    better understand the evolution of the solar wind structure.
    The Lyman-alpha photon counts from these observations can be used to build a more
    comprehensive picture of the solar wind structure and how it changes through the
    solar cycles.
    GLOWS design and assembly is led by the Space Research Center, Warsaw, Poland
    (CBK PAN). See https://imap.princeton.edu/instruments/glows for more details.
