  TEXT: &txt >
    The Compact Dual Ion Composition Experiment (CoDICE) will measure the distributions and composition of interstellar
    pickup ions (PUIs), particles that make it through the heliosheath into the heliosphere. CoDICE also collects and
    characterizes solar wind ions including the mass and composition of highly energized particles (called suprathermal)
    from the Sun. CoDICE combines an electrostatic analyzer(ESA) with a Time-Of-Flight versus Energy (TOF / E) subsystem
    to simultaneously measure the velocity, arrival direction, ionic charge state, and mass of specific species of ions in
    the LISM. CoDICE also has a path for higher energy particles to skip the ESA but still get measured by the common
    TOF / E system. These measurements are critical in determining the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) composition and
    flow properties, the origin of the enigmatic suprathermal tails on the solar wind distributions and advance
    understanding of the acceleration of particles in the heliosphere.
