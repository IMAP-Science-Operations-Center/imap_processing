  Hi>IMAP High-Energy (IMAP-Hi) Energetic Neutral Atom Imager
TEXT: &txt >
  IMAP-Hi consists of two identical, single-pixel high-energy energetic
  neutral atom (ENA) imagers mounted at fixed angles of 90 and 45 degrees
  relative to the spacecraft spin axis. These imagers measure neutral atoms
  entering our solar system from the outer edge of the heliosphere as they
  move towards the Sun. See https://imap.princeton.edu/instruments/imap-hi for
  more details.
