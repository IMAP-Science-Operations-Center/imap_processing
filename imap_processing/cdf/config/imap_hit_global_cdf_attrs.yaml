  TEXT: &txt >
    The High-energy Ion Telescope (HIT) measures the elemental composition, energy spectra,
    angle distributions, and arrival times of high-energy ions. HIT delivers full-sky
    coverage from a wide instrument field-of-view (FOV) to enable a high resolution of ion
    measurements, such as observing shock-accelerated ions, determining the origin of the
    solar energetic particles (SEPs) spectra, and resolving particle transport in the
    heliosphere. See https://imap.princeton.edu/instruments/hit for more details.
