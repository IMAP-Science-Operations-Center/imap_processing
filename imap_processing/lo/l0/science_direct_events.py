    The Science Direct Events class handles the parsing and

    Attributes
    ----------
    SHCOARSE : int
        Spacecraft time.
    COUNT: int
        Number of direct events.
    CHKSUM: int
        Checksum for the packet.
    DATA: str
        Compressed TOF Direct Event time tagged data.
    TOF0: int
        Time of Flight 0 value for direct event.
    TOF1: int
        Time of Flight 1 value for direct event.
    TOF2: int
        Time of Flight 2 value for direct event.
    TOF3: int
        Time of Flight 3 value for direct event.
    TIME: int
        time tag for the direct event
    ENERGY: int
        energy of the direct event ENA.
    POS: int
        Stop position for the direct event. There are 4 quadrants
        on the at the stop position.
    CKSM: int
        This is checksum defined relative to the TOFs
        condition for golden triples. If golden triples are below
        a certain threshold in checksum it's considered golden, otherwise,
        it's considered a silver triple. This is important for the compression
        for golden triples because it's used to recover TOF1 because
        compression scheme to save space on golden triples doesn't send
        down TOF1 so it's recovered on the ground using the checksum
    case_number: int
        The compression case number for the direct event. The case number
        determines how the bits are arranged in the compressed data.
    tof_calculation_binary: dict
        Binary used to determine which TOF coefficients should be used
        for decompressing the binary.
    tof_decoder: list
        Shows how the fields in the binary are split up by bit length and order.
    remaining_bits: dict
        The TOF coefficients that should be used for decompression
    parsed_bits: dict
        The binary bits split up by TOF field.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(packet, software_vesion, packet_file_name):
        Uses the CCSDS packet, version of the software, and
        the name of the packet file to parse and store information about
        the Direct Event packet data.
    decompress_data():
        Decompresses the Science Direct Event TOF data.
