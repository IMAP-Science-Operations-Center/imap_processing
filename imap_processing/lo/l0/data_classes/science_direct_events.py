class ScienceDirectEvents(LoBase):
    """L1A Science Direct Events data.

    The Science Direct Events class handles the parsing and
    decompression of L0 to L1A data.


    The TOF data in the binary is in the following order:
    ABSENT, TIME, ENERGY, MODE, TOF0, TOF1, TOF2, TOF3, CKSM, POS

    ABSENT, TIME, ENERGY, and MODE will be present for every type of DE.

    ABSENT: signals the case number for the DE (4 bits).
    TIME: the time of the DE (12 bits).
    ENERGY: Energy step (3 bits).
    MODE: Signals how the data is packed. If MODE is 1, then the TOF1
    (for case 1a) will need to be calculated using the checksum and other TOFs
    in the L1B data product.
    If MODE is 0, then there was no compression and all TOFs are transmitted.

    The presence of TOF0, TOF1, TOF2, TOF3, CKSM, and POS depend on the
    case number.

    - Case 0 can either be a gold or silver triple. Gold triples do
    not send down the TOF1 value and instead recover the TOF1 value
    on the ground using the decompressed checksum.
    - Cases 4, 6, 10, 12, 13 may be Bronze. If it's not a bronze,
    the Position is not transmitted, but TOF3 is. If it is bronze, the table
    should be used as is. If it's not bronze, position was not transmitted,
    but TOF3 was transmitted.
    - Cases 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13 will always have a MODE of 0, so the same
    fields will always be transmitted.

    Bit Shifting:
    TOF0, TOF1, TOF2, TOF3, and CKSM all must be shifted by one bit to the
    left. All other fields do not need to be bit shifted.

    The raw values are computed for L1A and will be converted to
    engineering units in L1B.

    Attributes
    ----------
    SHCOARSE : int
        Spacecraft time.
    COUNT: int
        Number of direct events.
    DATA: str
        Compressed TOF Direct Event time tagged data.
    TIME: numpy.ndarray
        time tag for the direct event
    ENERGY: numpy.ndarray
        energy of the direct event ENA.
    MODE: numpy.ndarray
        Indication of how the data is packed.
    TOF0: numpy.ndarray
        Time of Flight 0 value for direct event.
    TOF1: numpy.ndarray
        Time of Flight 1 value for direct event.
    TOF2: numpy.ndarray
        Time of Flight 2 value for direct event.
    TOF3: numpy.ndarray
        Time of Flight 3 value for direct event.
    CKSM: numpy.ndarray
        This is checksum defined relative to the TOFs
        condition for golden triples. If golden triples are below
        a certain threshold in checksum it's considered golden, otherwise,
        it's considered a silver triple. This is important for the compression
        for golden triples because it's used to recover TOF1 because
        compression scheme to save space on golden triples doesn't send
        down TOF1 so it's recovered on the ground using the checksum
    POS: numpy.ndarray
        Stop position for the direct event. There are 4 quadrants
        on the at the stop position.
