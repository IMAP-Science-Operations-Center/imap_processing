    """
    Decorator/wrapper that automatically furnishes SPICE kernels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    __func : Callable
        The function requiring SPICE that we are going to wrap if being used
        explicitly, otherwise None, in which case ensure_spice is being used,
        not as a function wrapper (see l2a_processing.py) but as a true
        decorator without an explicit function argument.
    time_kernels_only : bool
        Specify that we only need to furnish time kernels (if SPICE_METAKERNEL
        is set, we still just furnish that metakernel and assume the time
        kernels are included.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        Decorated function, with spice error handling.

    Notes
    -----
    Before trying to understand this piece of code, read this:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5929107/decorators-with-parameters/60832711#60832711

    **Control flow overview:**
    1. Try simply calling the wrapped function naively.
        * SUCCESS? Great! We're done.
        * SpiceyError? Go to step 2.

    2. Furnish metakernel at SPICE_METAKERNEL
        * SUCCESS? Great, return the original function again (so it can be
          re-run).
        * KeyError? Seems like SPICE_METAKERNEL isn't set, no problem. Go to
          step 3.

    3. Did we get the parameter time_kernels_only=True?
    --> YES? We only need LSK and SCLK kernels to run this function. Go fetch
        those and furnish and return the original function (so it can be re-run).
    --> NO? Dang. This is sort of the end of the line. Re-raise the error
        generated from the failed spiceypy function call but add a better
        message to it.

    Examples
    --------
    There are three ways to use this object

    1. A decorator with no arguments
        >>> @ensure_spice
        ... def my_spicey_func(a, b):
        ...     pass

    2. A decorator with parameters. This is useful
    if we only need the latest SCLK and LSK kernels for the function involved.
        >>> @ensure_spice(time_kernels_only=True)
        ... def my_spicey_time_func(a, b):
        ...     pass

    3. An explicit wrapper function, providing a dynamically set value for
    parameters, e.g. time_kernels_only
        >>> wrapped = ensure_spice(spicey_func, time_kernels_only=True)
        ... result = wrapped(*args, **kwargs)
