class MagL1aPacketProperties:

    Data class with Mag L1A per-packet data.

    This contains per-packet variations in L1a data that is passed into CDF
    files. Since each L1a file contains multiple packets, the variables in this
    class vary by time in the end CDF file.

    seconds_per_packet, and total_vectors are calculated from pus_ssubtype and
    vecsec values, which are only passed in to the init method and cannot be
    accessed from an instance as they are InitVars.

    To use the class, pass in pus_ssubtype and either PRI_VECSEC or SEC_VECSEC,
    then you can access seconds_per_packet and total_vectors.

class MagL1a:
    """
    Data class for MAG Level 1A data.

    One MAG L1A object corresponds to part of one MAG L0 packet, which corresponds to
    one packet of data from the MAG instrument. Each L0 packet consists of data from
    two sensors, MAGO (outboard) and MAGI (inboard). One of these sensors is designated
    as the primary sensor (first part of data stream), and one as the secondary.

    We expect the primary sensor to be MAGO, and the secondary to be MAGI, but this is
    not guaranteed. Each MagL1A object contains data from one sensor. The
    primary/secondary construct is only used to sort the vectors into MAGo and MAGi
    data, and therefore is not used at higher levels.

        """
        Given raw compressed packet data, process into Vectors.

        To do this, we need to decode the compressed data. The compressed data starts
        with an 8 bit header that defines the width of the uncompressed vectors and
        if there is a range data section. Then, the vector data follows, then the range
        data section if it exists.

        To decode, we start by decoding the first compression_width bits. This is an
        uncompressed primary vector with range. Then, we proceed through the compressed
        data, where each value is fibonacci and zig-zag encoded. This means each value
        ends in 2 sequential ones (11). We split the data along these numbers until
        we reach primary_count vectors.

        The secondary vectors are decoded the same way, starting directly after the last
        primary vector with an uncompressed secondary starting vector and then
        secondary_count compressed vectors.

        The compressed values are differences from the previous vector, so after
        decoding we accumulate the values starting from the first known vector. The
        range data is copied from the starting vector if range_data_section is not
        included.

        Then, if a range data section is included, we decode it and assign it to each
        vector. There are 2 * (primary_count + secondary_count) bits assigned for the
        range data section.

        If any compressed vectors are > 60 bits long (MAX_COMPRESSED_VECTOR_BITS), then
        we switch to uncompressed vectors for the rest of the processing.
