class MagL1aPacketProperties:
    """
    Data class with Mag L1A per-packet data.

    This contains per-packet variations in L1a data that is passed into CDF
    files. Since each L1a file contains multiple packets, the variables in this
    class vary by time in the end CDF file.

    seconds_per_packet, and total_vectors are calculated from pus_ssubtype and
    vecsec values, which are only passed in to the init method and cannot be
    accessed from an instance as they are InitVars.

    To use the class, pass in pus_ssubtype and either PRI_VECSEC or SEC_VECSEC,

class MagL1a:
    """
    Data class for MAG Level 1A data.

    One MAG L1A object corresponds to part of one MAG L0 packet, which corresponds to
    one packet of data from the MAG instrument. Each L0 packet consists of data from
    two sensors, MAGO (outboard) and MAGI (inboard). One of these sensors is designated
    as the primary sensor (first part of data stream), and one as the secondary.

    We expect the primary sensor to be MAGO, and the secondary to be MAGI, but this is
    not guaranteed. Each MagL1A object contains data from one sensor. The
    primary/secondary construct is only used to sort the vectors into MAGo and MAGi
    data, and therefore is not used at higher levels.
