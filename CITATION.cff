  The Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) is
  a project aimed at studying the interstellar medium and
  investigating the acceleration mechanisms of particles
  within our galaxy. IMAP utilizes cutting-edge technology
  and advanced instrumentation to gather valuable data and
  expand our understanding of space. The Science Data Center
  (SDC) is under the Science Operations Center (SOC), located
  at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP),
  and is responsible for the data processing on the IMAP mission.
